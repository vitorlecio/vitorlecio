## Hi, I'm **Vitor LL Fontanella**.

I am a Data Scientist with a background in Physics, currently based in Nice, France. My work focuses primarily on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and applied machine learning. I have experience with domain-specific language modeling, ambiguity detection, embeddings-based classification, and Large Language Model (LLM) adaptation. Beyond NLP, I am eager to work on broader data science problems involving modeling, prediction, and data-driven decision making. My background in physics provides strong mathematical and analytical foundations, allowing me to quickly adapt to new domains and technical challenges.
